# Nfl Player and Team Analysis 
by Seth Fried
## Background
The purpose of this project was to practice gathering data, manipulating data, and drawing conclusions from the data that can inform Fantasy managers while drafting NFL players. Instead of doing a straightforward analysis one one dataset the goal was to use mutliple sources (see acknowledments) and combine them to find correlations that might not be immediatly obvious. The scope of this analysis covers both NFL players and NFL teams from 2006-2024. 

## Data
For this project I collected average draft positions (ADP) data and player game logs to see if they under or overperformed their expected value, player's college stats and combines to see if there was any correlation between their pre NFL stats and their NFL success, and finally team game logs to see how teams performed across the two decade timeline. The players that were included in this analysis were the ones that were fantasy relevant meaning they are either a tight end, wide reciever, quarter back, or running back and they played at least one snap in a season. There are also a few other pieces of data (like stadiums) that I included in the repo as I intend to do more analysis with them.
## Analysis
For the analysis I will break it up into four parts for the four jupyter notebooks I used to calculate statistics and make graphs. The four notebooks cover the ADP, combine, draft position, and team analysis.
